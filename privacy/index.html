        <br>

        </p>
        <h5>6.4 Third party service providers</h5>

        <h5>6.5 Business re-organisation</h5>
        <p>In instances where CIL or its affiliates are subject to a re-organisation, such as a merger or acquisition of some or all of its assets, we may, in accordance with our legitimate interests, need to share information in the course of the transaction. In such circumstances, your information may be disclosed, where permitted by applicable law, in connection with such corporate restructuring, sale, or assignment of assets, merger, or other changes of control or financial status of CIL or its affiliate.</p>
        <h5>6.6 Legal and safety reasons</h5>
        <p>We may retain, preserve, or share your personal information if we have a good-faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to (a) respond, based on applicable law, to a legal request (such as, a subpoena, search warrant, court order, or other request from government or law enforcement); (b) detect, investigate, prevent, and address fraud and other illegal activity, security, or technical issues; (c) protect our rights, property, or safety; (d) enforce our Terms and Conditions or any other agreements we have with you; or (e) prevent physical injury or other harm to any person or entity, including yourself and members of the general public.</p>
        <h5>6.7 Aggregated information</h5>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>7. Data retention</h4>
        <p>
          We will retain your personal information for as long as is necessary, up to a period of three years after such information is collected, to achieve the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, such as to provide you with the Services. If we record a call to you for training and development purposes, we will delete the recording after a period of 4 weeks. We may also need to retain some of your information for a longer period to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our
          <a href='/terms'>Terms of Service</a>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>8. Data transfers</h4>
        <p>As a global business, we access and transfer information around the world. If you are based in the EU, this means that we access and transfer your personal information outside the EU, including in and to the United States. The privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your personal information in some of these countries may not be the same as in your home country. We transfer your personal information in accordance with law, and take steps to ensure that your information is appropriately protected.</p>
        <p>In particular, where we transfer information to countries that are not viewed as providing adequate protections, we generally rely on an approved mechanism known as the “standard contractual clauses” to protect the information transferred. These are template contracts published by the European Commission containing approved commitments to protect the privacy and security of the information transferred. To request a copy of the clauses, please contact us.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>9. Your rights</h4>
        <p>You have a number of rights in relation to your information that we process. While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited cases. We describe these rights below.</p>
        <h5>9.1 Access and Porting</h5>
        <p>
          You can access much of your information by logging into your Conference profile. If you require access to additional information, or you do not have a Conference profile, please
          <a href='mailto:info@shiftconf.co'>contact us.</a>
          Where legally required, we will provide your information in an easily accessible format and assist in transferring some of this information to third parties.
        </p>
        <h5>9.2 Rectify, Restrict, Delete</h5>
        <p>You can amend, update and delete some of your information by logging into your Conference profile. If you don’t have a Conference profile, or want us to amend, update or delete other information, please contact us.</p>
        <h5>9.3 Object</h5>
        <p>Where we process your information based on the legitimate interests described above, or in the public interest, you can object to the processing in certain circumstances. We will generally stop processing your information unless we have compelling grounds to continue processing, such as where needed for legal reasons. Where we use your information for direct marketing, you can always object using the unsubscribe link in such communications, changing your profile settings or by contacting us. Where we inform you that we will record a call to you, we will provide you with the opportunity to object to such recording.</p>
        <h5>9.4 Revoke consent</h5>
        <p>
          If we have specifically asked for your consent to use your information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. For example, if we ask for your consent for direct marketing purposes, you can revoke your consent using the unsubscribe link in such communications, changing your profile settings or by
          <a href='mailto:info@shiftconf.co'>contacting us</a>
        </p>
        <h5>9.5 Complain</h5>
        <p>If you wish to raise a concern about our use of your information (and without prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the right to do so with your local supervisory authority or CIL’s lead supervisory authority, the Irish Data Protection Commission.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>10. Security</h4>
        <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We strive to use appropriate technical and organisational to protect your personal information. Despite these measures, the Internet is not a fully secure environment and we cannot guarantee that your personal information won’t be intercepted or improperly accessed.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>11. Children</h4>
        <p>
          Attendees under 18 years of age may attend the Conference if accompanied by an adult or guardian, depending on the age of the attendee. You can find further information our age limitations in our
          <a href='/terms'>Terms and Conditions</a>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>12. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time so please review it occasionally. If we make material changes, we will take steps to notify you. The date of the most recent revisions will appear on the top of this page.</p>
